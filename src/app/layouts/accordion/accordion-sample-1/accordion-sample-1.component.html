                We have moved to a subscription-based pricing model for all our developer tools. This makes it easier
                for you to manage your license subscriptions and allows us to provide a better level of service for you.

                We updated our pricing and packages to provide you with flexible options and the best value. This
                includes <a href="https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui">Ignite UI </a>(formerly Ignite UI for
                JavaScript) which includes all of our JavaScript framework
                components for web development, including: Angular, ASP.NET (Core and MVC), Blazor, JQuery, React and
                Web Components), as well as Infragistics Professional, Infragistics Ultimate, our Ultimate UI products.

                We also offer multi-year subscriptions options with a built-in discount, so you can see the value up
                front. With these updates we are confident that we are providing the best platforms and the best price.

                The license updates will impact all new and current customers using Ignite UI, Infragistics Professional
                and Infragistics Ultimate. Specifically, we have also made updates to our product and packaging for
                Ignite UI for JavaScript, Ignite UI for Angular, Ignite UI for React and Ignite UI for Web components.

                    Changes to Ignite UI Product & Packaging</a>

                The pricing has been updated for all products and packages. So, all new or additional licenses will be
                sold based on our new pricing and packages. All existing license agreements will be honored and renewed
                based upon the current agreement.

                For Ignite UI customers, we are moving away from NPM for licensed packages. The current NPM packages
                will be replaced with packages that include a “Trial Version” watermark. Licensed packages for Ignite UI
                will be available from our cloud hosted ProGet server.

                For more information, please refer to this article:

            <igx-expansion-panel-body>
                Any unlicensed or trial versions of Ignite UI for Angular, React and Web Components will now include
                this watermark.

                Any version of Infragistics software which you have downloaded can continue to be used perpetually.
                Access to download any new or previous versions through our customer portal and package feeds will
                require maintaining an active subscription by continuing to renew it.

            </igx-expansion-panel-header>
            <igx-expansion-panel-body>
                Any new subscriptions purchased online, via our eCommerce system, will renew automatically. Subscription
                renewal can be canceled, at any time, before the next automatic renewal date. Subscriptions purchased
                directly from Infragistics or Infragistics’ partners are subject to the renewal terms that were agreed
                upon as part of that purchase.

            </igx-expansion-panel-header>
            <igx-expansion-panel-body>
                The Infragistics Ultimate license is tied to the user, and not the computer. That means you’re welcome
                to install and use Ignite UI, Infragistics Professional, and Infragistics Ultimate on any computer you
                use. However, if we notice a large number of activations using the same license, we may contact you to
                verify this behavior.

                <igx-expansion-panel-title>I used up my trial for an earlier version of Infragistics Ultimate. Can I
                    start a
                    new trial when a major version is released?</igx-expansion-panel-title>
            </igx-expansion-panel-header>
            <igx-expansion-panel-body>
                Yes! If you have tried a previous version in the past, and used up your 30-day trial, you can try the
                next major version for another 30 days! You can do this in the following two ways:

                <ul>
                    <li>If you have days remaining in your 30-day trial period for the current version (e.g., the
                        Version 15.1 Volume Release), use the Check for Update option inside the Platform Installer or
                        your account. You will be able to start a fresh trial for the next major version (e.g., 20.1
                        Volume Release)</li>
                    <li>If you have used up the 30-day trial for the previous major version (e.g., the 19.2 Volume
                        Release), simply download and install Infragistics Ultimate from our <a
                            href="https://www.infragistics.com/products/ultimate">website</a> (This will also allow you
                        to start a new trial.)</li>
                </ul>
