      <h2>Prerequisites to using Ignite UI for Angular</h2>
      <p>Before you can run Ignite UI for Angular, there are 2 steps to get everything on your machine set up to run any Angular
        app, including Ignite UI for Angular, and to build Ignite UI for Angular apps.
        <br>
        <br>To get started, you must install both NodeJS and Visual Studio Code on your machine. Modern web development with
        Angular requires NodeJS, it's sort of like an ASP.NET app running in the browser requires ASP.NET runtime deployed
        on the server. For development, there is nothing better than Visual Studio Code to build Angular apps. Getting started
        is easy, just download and install both Node.js and Visual Studio Code.</p>

      <h3>Step-by-Step</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Unzip the package to your hard drive. </li>
        <li>Open the project by right-clicking anywhere in the folder that you've just unzipped and selecting “Open with Code”
          from the context menu. If you do not have a right-click option to Open in Code, or you are running a Mac, simply
          open Visual Studio Code and from the File menu select Open Folder and select the folder you just unzipped. </li>
        <li>Once Visual Studio Code is open, you should see the samples folders in the Explorer pane. </li>
        <li>In Visual Studio Code, from the “View” menu, select “Integrated Terminal”. </li>
        <li>Type
          <span class="code-snippet">npm install</span> at the command line in the integrated terminal. </li>
        <li>Once the
          <span class="code-snippet">npm install</span> completes, type npm start at the command line in the integrated terminal.</li>
        <li>Your browser should open to http://localhost:4200 with the Ignite UI for Angular samples running.</li>

      <h2>Building your first Ignite UI for Angular app</h2>
      <p>After you've looked at the Ignite UI for Angular samples and explored the online docs, it's time to get started building
        your first Ignite UI for Angular app. Using the Ignite UI for Angular CLI (Command Line Interface), it's super-easy
        to get started building full-featured Angular apps. Our CLI gives you the ability to initialize, develop, scaffold,
        and maintain applications in Angular with Ignite UI, all with pre-set navigation, templates for each control and
        full screen views that can help you kick off any type of Angular app development.
        <br>
        <br>We've included 2 videos that will help you install the pre-requisites and walk you through using the Ignite UI for
        Angular CLI to build your first Ignite UI for Angular app.</p>
